## TONeful -- your 1-on-1 video call app for consultation sessions

Imagine you booked a 60 minutes consultation session with a lawyer. The lawyer had charged you 120 Euro for it. However, he was late for 10 minutes, picked up another 5 minutes call meanwhile, and left you 5 minutes early. The effective consulting time was only (less than) 40 minutes -- you could have saved 40 Euros or more! 

Similarly, you booked another conversation session with a doctor. You have a long list of questions, including how people usually take care of themselves in your situations, what are the effective next steps, potential medical fees etc. However, as you had only paid for 1 session, the doctor interrupted you towards the end of the session and suggested you to book another time slot. How annoying -- some of your questions are still left hanging!

Here we introduce TONeful v0.0.1 exactly for these problems. TONeful is a 1-on-1 video call app dedicated to improve the service quality of professionals -- it charges the customers in consultation sessions per minute, instead of per session or hour. The professionals are able to set their TON per minute before the calls, and the customers will need to agree upon it before the calls start. A timer will be visible to both the professional and the customer during a call, and the customer will be able to pause or stop the timer anytime they wish. 

TONeful enables the customers to talk 1-on-1 with the professionals without being interrupted by session limitations, and only being charged according to their service quality. Alternatively, the high-quality professionals will also be rewarded by receiving the TONs they deserve.

We will dedicate the section below to a brief overview of the TONeful prototype. The links to YouTube introduction and working prototype (GitHub) are also provided at the end of this article.
